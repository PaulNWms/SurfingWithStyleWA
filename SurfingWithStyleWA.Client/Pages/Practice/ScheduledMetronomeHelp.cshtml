    <h1>Help for the Scheduled Metronome</h1>

    <h2>What is a "scheduled metronome"?</h2>
    <p>
        The scheduled metronome is a metronome that runs a scheduled routine.  Its intended for the "mindless" portion of your
        practice routine - scale studies, picking exercises, speed drills and the like.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you use it?</h2>
    <p>The basic usage is, you enter a routine, you save it, and then you play it back with instument in hand.</p>

    <h3>To enter your schedule:</h3>
    <p>Basically, each exercise has a tempo, a duration, and name.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The tempo is the mm or bpm on your metronome.  There are no restrictions, but values below mm=30 or above mm=208 are not likely to work too well.
        </li>
        <li>
            The duration can be entered in [seconds] or in [minutes]:[seconds].  It works similar to the display on a microwave oven.  A value of
            '90' will be interpreted as 1 minute and 30 seconds, '1:90' will be interpreted as 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>Enter the name of the exercise as a free-form string.  Best to keep it short.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each row also has an add button and a delete button, these work in the usual way.</p>

    <p>After the schedule are a few global options.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Rest between exercises:</b> In practice, we need a little time between exercises to get ready for the next one - to flip a page, to change position,
            or to just mentally prepare. Defaults to 5 sec.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Start routine with a rest:</b> Just as you need a little pause to set up before each exercise, you will generally want to set up before the
            <em>first</em> exercise - but not always.  Occasionally you just want to hit the ground running.  An example of this would be a demo link.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>End each exercise with a bell:</b> Often it's hard to hear when the metronome stops, especially if you're playing directly on the beat.
            By default this is cued by a bell that rings at the end of each exercise, but you can turn that off if you want.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To save your schedule:</h3>
    <p>
        Although this step is optional, for obvious reasons you will want to save your routine.  The 'editor' is admittedly clunky, especially on a mobile device.
    </p>

    <p>Now it gets a little bit technical, but you'll need to understand this. Saving is two-step process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Press the 'Create Link' button.  This will post back to the server, and in a few seconds it will respond with a new URL.  Look at the URL
            line in your browser.  This is your schedule, in encoded form.  Most likely it has been added to your browser history as well, but I wouldn't
            rely on that.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now you will need to save it somewhere.  This part is up to you.  You can bookmark it in your current browser, or save it anywhere
            you like to save your links.  (Personally, I like to copy and paste them into a text file which I keep on my OneDrive.)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The takeaway is that the schedule is not stored anywhere on the site, it's encoded in the link.  Managing your links is your own responsibility.</p>

    <h3>To play back your schedule:</h3>
    <p>Press the play button.  Press a second time to pause.</p>

    <p>
        Note that by default, your schedule will start with a rest.  This may seem crazy at first, but it's by design. Through usage we are
        conditioned to start a metronome, <em>and then</em> pick up the instrument and settle into an exercise with the metronome <em>already running</em>.
        Just because it's been done that way for hundreds of years doesn't make it optimal.  I prefer to start the routine, get situatated
        with my instrument and be fully prepared when the routine starts.
    </p>

    <p>Of course if this is too disconcerting, just uncheck 'Start routine with a rest'.</p>

    <h2>Special uses:</h2>
    <h3>Playing out of time</h3>
    <p>
        Certain exercises are best played without a metronome.  A good example of this are certain drum rudiments.
        Suppose your routine includes a buzz roll and you don't want the metronome engaged for the duration of that exercise.
        Just set the tempo to 0.  When the tempo is 0, a bell will sound at the <em>beginning</em> as well as the end of an exercise,
        so you know when to start.
    </p>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Several small schedules are more effective than trying to cram your whole exercise routine into one big one.  In life,
            things rarely go as planned, and your routine(s) should take that into account.
        </li>
        <li>
            The metronome rate is <em>reasonably</em> accurate, but not perfect.  I have noticed a very slight difference in playback speed
            on various browsers and devices.  This is a problem in the underlying hardware and browser, not the web application.  It is not fixable.
        </li>
        <li>
            Please report bugs.  I can't possibly test the application on every platform.  If you do report a bug, please include device,
            OS version and browser version.
        </li>
        <li>Actually, any constructive feedback is helpful.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
